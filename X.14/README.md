* 1 Write a Checked_ptr<T> that uses exceptions to signal run-time errors for a pointer supposed to point to an element of an array (or one-beyond-the-end-of the array).

* 2 Write a function that searches a binary tree of nodes based on a char∗ field for a match. If a node containing hello is found, find("hello") will return a pointer to that node. Use an exception to indicate ‘‘not found.’’

写一个函数，搜索匹配基于字符∗场节点二叉树。如果找到包含hello的节点，查找（“hello”）将返回指向该节点的指针。使用异常来表示“发现。”

* 3 Define a class Int that acts exactly like the built-in type int , except that it throws exceptions rather than overflowing or underflowing.

定义一个int，行为上像内置类型int，除了它抛出异常而不是溢出或下溢。
