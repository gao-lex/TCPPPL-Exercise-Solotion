* 1 Write a Checked_ptr<T> that uses exceptions to signal run-time errors for a pointer supposed to point to an element of an array (or one-beyond-the-end-of the array).

---

* 2 Write a function that searches a binary tree of nodes based on a char∗ field for a match. If a node containing hello is found, find("hello") will return a pointer to that node. Use an exception to indicate ‘‘not found.’’

---

* 3 Define a class Int that acts exactly like the built-in type int , except that it throws exceptions rather than overflowing or underflowing.

---

* 4 Take the basic operations for opening, closing, reading, and writing from the C interface to your operating system and provide equivalent C++ functions that call the C functions but throw exceptions in case of errors.
